        <p>
          I have just completed my bachelor&apos;s in Software Engineering at
          Islamic University of Technology. Right now, I am looking for any
          opportunity that would allow me to enhance my current abilities and
          learn new things from the people who are working in the industry.

        <h4>Experience</h4>
        <p>
          I was assigned to a railway project where I had to work in angular
          over ionic framework; I worked on the camera feature of the mobile
          app. Secondly, I was assigned to a restructuring project where I had
          built components in angular which were previously built on angular js.
